AURA – AI-Powered Health Assistant (Prototype)
🚀 Overview

AURA (formerly Arogya Mithra) is a prototype digital assistant developed during the Dawn of Code Hackathon 2025.
It focuses on interactive health guidance through a clean TypeScript + CSS frontend, demonstrating UI/UX design, rapid prototyping, and interactivity.

⚡ Note: This is a prototype (frontend-only). Backend/AI integration will be added in future versions.



🧩 Features

Even as a prototype, AURA showcases:

Interactive UI: Users can input health queries or options and see immediate responses.

Responsive Design: Works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Visual Feedback: Clear UI elements guide the user through the interaction.

Prototype Logic: Demonstrates the intended behavior for health guidance and personalization.
